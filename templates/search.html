              <h4>Godson Ovie Arthur</h4>
              <p>Are you looking for someone who can build an e-commerce website that provides your business with the essential marketing tools to expand? I'm your guy; the e-commerce sites i build provide it's owners with four(4) marketing functions that'll help any business owner expand it's business. They are; 1. discount and special offer, 2. Google SEO, 3. Customer information gathering and multi email notifications from your site, 4. Referral system/Affiliate marketing system for your site to work with freelance marketers or influencers to promote your site</p>
            </div>
            <div class="left-content">
              <h4>1. Discount and special offer</h4>
              <p>This function gives you the option of offering a discount or special offer to one or more products on your website and allows to set the date the offer will expire. once the today's date matches your the expiry date of the offer, your site will be programmed to automatically delete the offer and reset price of affected product back to its original price.

            </div>
            <div class="left-content">
              <h4>2. Google SEO(Search Engine Optimization)</h4>
              <p>Let me tell you a story. My Father wanted to upload his book on Amazon and receive payments in Nigeria but didn't know how; so he searched on google and found an article on how to do that by a microfinance bank called "Grey". Grey wrote an article on how to receive payment from Amazon and also gave two options: 1. Use btc which was a long process or 2. open an account with them and receive payment easily. The technique here is that Grey used the fact that people needed this information and would search it on google to market themselves on their article. I can create a blog for your website and register it with Google so that you can use the same strategy either by hiring a professional SEO writer or using AI to write and optimize your Search Engine Optimization(SEO)</p>
            </div>
            <div class="left-content">
              <h4>3. Customer Information gathering/Lead generation</h4>
              <p>imagine a website that not only gathers the information of customers that sign up to your site but also notifies them on new products on your site and special offers. If you hire me to build your e-commerce site; trust me, you never have to save customer details yourself manually. The sites I build extract your customers' information into a CSV file (Excel sheet) for download, if you fear the information being lost if your website is down or license revoked</p>
            </div>
            <div class="left-content">
              <h4>4. Referral system/Affiliate marketing system</h4>
              <p>Let me tell you a story. Andrew Tate was a retired boxer who wanted to start an online course for people who wanted to make money but didn't know how. Until, he discovered TikTok which was just introduced that year. Andrew discovered that for first time users, TikTok allowed their videos to go viral and would keep recommending it to people that engaged and liked it. So he had a plan; he created an online learning site with a referral system that allowed people to earn when they refer a person. Andrew managed to convince people to spread his marketing vidoes and paste their referral links on TikTok to go viral and earn at least $2 million dollars while freelance marketers registered on his site earned a range of $1000 to $2000 that year. I can build a site that can help you use the same strategy. The websites i build give customers that register and wish to earn an Affiliate link of your website; in otherwords, it generates a personal link they can use to refer people to your site or market in a platform someone. This function will enable you to work with not just freelance marketers but also influencers that you may know if the commissions you offer are enticing enough. Log in using this staff account of the website to experiment: Username: shades, Password: 54321; while creating a product, you'll see a field called "commission"; it set based on percentage(i.e 8%, 10% etc). once a commission has been set, any marketer that promotes that product with his affiliate link will earn the percentage commission you set and you can do two things either you let them use it as coupon to purchase something on your site or let them withdraw their balance into their bank. Once the customer they refer pays for that product,they earn a commission. </p>
